The `Key` parameter is used to name the file when it's uploaded to DSS.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `boto3` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install boto3\n```\n\nAlso, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the file and to upload files to the specified bucket."

        "output": "The API for creating a bucket in DSS is part of the S3-Compatible API. Developers can create a bucket using the CreateBucket operation. The bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in DSS and must comply with DSS bucket naming rules. The bucket name can be between 3 and 63 characters long, can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-), and must begin and end with a letter or number. For more information, see Create Bucket in the Oort DSS S3-Compatible API Reference."
